Things to remember to look at:
    1. check if there is a way to make it so a sprite can't see through walls for tracking.
    2. knockback on collision, check how to call the enemy knockback not he global one.
    3. how to call an enemy function from a foreach loop or collision method.
    4. arrow collision boxes
